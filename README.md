# Java Foundations

This repository contains my foundational Java practice, organized by topic.
The goal of this repo is to reinforce core Java concepts before moving into
larger backend and Spring Boot projects.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Collections (HashMap, HashSet, ArrayList)
- Strings (upcoming)

Each folder contains focused practice problems with documentation
and clean implementations.
