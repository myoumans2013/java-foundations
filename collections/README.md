## Collections Practice

This folder contains Java practice problems using core collection types.

Collections covered:

- ArrayList: ordered, resizable collections
- HashSet: fast lookup, no duplicates
- HashMap: key-value associations

These problems focus on choosing the correct data structure
based on performance and use case.
